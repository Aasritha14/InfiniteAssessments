        <h2 class="Story-title">Peacock and Owl</h2>
        <div >
            <p class="Story-Box"> Once upon a time in a lush green forest, there lived a peacock with feathers so dazzling that every creature admired its beauty. The peacock loved to show off, spreading its colorful tail whenever the sun shone bright. It believed that beauty was the greatest gift of all.
            One day, dark clouds gathered, and heavy rain began to pour. The peacock tried to dance, but the muddy ground spoiled its feathers. Feeling sad, it wandered near a quiet pond and saw a nightingale singing sweetly under a tree. The melody was so enchanting that even the rain seemed to soften.
            The peacock sighed, “I wish I could sing like that. My beauty is useless in this storm.”
             The wise old owl nearby said, “Every creature has its own gift. Yours is beauty, the nightingales is song. Instead of wishing for what you lack, celebrate what you have.”
            The peacock realized its mistake. From that day on, it admired others talents without envy and shared its beauty with joy, making the forest a happier place.</br></p>
